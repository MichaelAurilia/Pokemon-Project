# Sample-Project
To run this program, download all files and use the PokemonRunner file to run the program. This code simulates a Pokemon battle where you select an action while the
computer selects a random option in turn based style. The objective is to win the battle by reducing the opposing Pokemon to 0hp with the one you choose at the
beginning. You can either attack with one of 4 moves, Use an item to heal your Pokemon, or run away from the battle which will end the program. The computer will then 
move after you picking one of those options at random. Each Pokemon has a specific type that is weak to, strong against, neutral against, or has no effect on moves of
certain types. If you hit a Pokemon with a move they are weak to it will deal double damage, If you hit a Pokemon with a move it is strong against it will take half
damage, if you hit a Pokemon with a move it is neutral against it will deal regular damage, and if you hit a Pokemon with a move that has no effect on it will deal zero
damage. Move damage is calculated with a damage formula that takes the attacking Pokemon's attack stat and the opposing Pokemon's defense stat as well as the move itselfs
power. The plan is to expand upon this program at a later date to include Pokemon with two types, new types, more usuable items, and more than two usuable Pokemon.
